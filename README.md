# Welcome

RestoRant is a site where users 'rant' and 'rave' about their experiences and opinions about the restaurants they have visited.

This was a simple-enough coding project for Year 1.2 of poly. Although this is not going to be proposed or to be released in the long run, I hope you enjoy testing this portable website, and appreciating the time I took to code all of this.

You can find and execute the SQL files in the "sql" folder.
